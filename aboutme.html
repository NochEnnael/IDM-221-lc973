                Hello there! My name is Leanne Chin and I am currently in my Sophomore Year in Drexel University studying Interactive Digital Media. All my life I have lived in beautiful, lively NYC, yet I have switched to a completely new city to live in. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Although changing from NYC to Philly has been a huge jump, growing up in the "city that never sleeps" has exposed me to many different cultures and industries that I try to apply to my everday life.

                Growing up, I was trained for dance in the heart of the Theater District. Living in that industry allowed me to create a strong love for musical theater. It has always been a strong, yet temporary escape from the grueling realities that we live in. While I was out of dance and out of my daydreaming fantasies, I was always in different types of sports ranging from basketball to golf, or from ice skating to gymnastics. The adrenaline rush that rushed through my body as I sprinted towards the net to stop a volleyball from touching the floor was unlike anything that you can feel. The constant energy that I got from dance and sports factored very much into the happiness that I exerted each day, bringing smiles to my face and to others.

                However, the number one thing that hugs my heart the most, growing the widest grin, is my love of Disney. When you first think of Disney, what is the first thing that comes to mind? Maybe childish, or is it magical? For me, itâ€™s a magical fantasy that is purely amazing. Disney has created these worlds that always pulls you into their stories, and out of our horrifying realities in the real world. Not only that, but brings back our fondest childhood memories. Disney simply knows how to make my inner child shine through. It not only helped me through the good times and the bad times, but it has helped me connect with others of all ages. Whenever possible, I try to sprinkle a bit of my own Disney magic.

             When I did jump back into reality, I enjoyed much of my time trying to participate in volunteering events. Much of my time in high school, I participated in Key Club. Their objective was to help high school students develop leadership skills along with gaining an appreciation for community service. Some events I attended included helping create Thanksgiving baskets at Elmhurst Hospital and making food for "Kids Day" at LaGuardia Airport.

             I have continued to pursue volunteering opportunites in Drexel by joining the Campus Activites Board (CAB). Creating marketing materials and working events as a member of CAB has allowed me to continue doing what I love, while raising the spirits of people at the school. Not only that, but by joining the club Dac Pack, I continue my love for sports by  cheer on the sidelines for Drexel's basketball teams. Knowing that I can raise spirits up for even a small amount of people brings me joy.
